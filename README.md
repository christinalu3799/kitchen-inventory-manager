## Project Description

The motivation behind this app stems from my current position as a manager for a small ramen restaurant. Often when working with the general manager on my team, I've noticed the inefficiency in using a Google spreadsheet to keep track of inventory every week. With endless rows and columns of items, he is consantly scrolling and resizing the spreadsheet to view the data for each item. Also, the general manager often complains of how difficult it is to see the items that need to be ordered again soon. 

I wanted to create a simple, user-friendly app that solves many of these common problems that other small business owners may face. The purpose of this app is to make taking inventory much more streamlined through the clean user interface and intuitive user experience when adding and modifying items in the inventory.
